# Only Read Aloud Content
Only Read Aloud Content is a Chrome extension for all Chromium web browsers (Chrome, Chromium, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Brave, etc.) that adds a `aria-hidden=true` attribute to common non-content text in between actual content. The purpose is to allow users who use screen readers for convenience, rather than out of necessity, to have it skip repetitive text from being read aloud.
